When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when colloborating with others
when displaying my work to public or fellow developers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

as GitHub is setup as public account in most cases, it would create problems
people would be able to see my WIP stuff which could be wrong

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

forks used when we want to modify someone's repository but dont have permission
clone is to copy contents from remote to local repository or make local copies of same repository
branch is used for making new streams within same repository (like when you want to experiment with the code)
