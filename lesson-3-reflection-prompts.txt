When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when colloborating with others
when displaying my work to public or fellow developers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

as GitHub is setup as public account in most cases, it would create problems
people would be able to see my WIP stuff which could be wrong
